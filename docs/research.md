## Competitive Overview

| List | Stars (approx.) | Coverage (of 15 categories) |
|------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents | ~25.7k | 1 (Frameworks) |
| sorrycc/awesome-code-agents | ~108 | 4 (IDEs, Terminal, VS Code, Vibe) |
| wong2/awesome-mcp-servers | ~35k | 1 (MCP) |
| appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers | ~10k | 1 (MCP) |

| kyrolabs/awesome-agents | ~1.5k | 1 (Frameworks) |
| saviorand/awesome-ai-assisted-coding | ~200 | 5 (IDEs, CLI, VS Code, Context, Learning) |

Our list covers all **15 categories** (IDEs, Terminal, VS Code, Frameworks, MCP, Skills, Context, Local Models, Vibe, Security, DevOps, Observability, Testing, Benchmarks, Learning), which no single competitor currently achieves.

## Gap Matrix

**Strongly covered by competitors:**

- MCP servers (wong2, appcypher)
- Vibe coding (filipecalegario)

**Almost entirely missing from competitors:**

- Agent Security (OWASP Agentic AI, sandboxing)
- Context Engineering (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, llms.txt)
- Benchmarks & Evaluation (SWE-bench, Aider Polyglot)
- Agent Skills marketplaces (skills.sh, Claude Skills)
- Local Models & Self-Hosted (Ollama, vLLM, coding models)
- LLM Provider Compatibility matrix
- Observability & Tracing (Langfuse, LangSmith, Phoenix)
- Testing & Quality (promptfoo, DeepEval, Inspect AI)

These niches are highlighted as dedicated sections in our list.
